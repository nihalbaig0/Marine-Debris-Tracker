## Project Details

Welcome to RoboRover, an exciting robotics project that focuses on developing an autonomous rover navigation system. This project aims to create a versatile robotic platform capable of navigating through different environments using advanced sensors and algorithms.

### Features:

- **Autonomous Navigation:** RoboRover utilizes state-of-the-art sensors, including LiDAR, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors, to navigate autonomously in dynamic environments. The robot can avoid obstacles and plan efficient paths.

- **ROS Integration:** The project is built on the Robot Operating System (ROS), providing a modular and scalable architecture for developing complex robotic systems. This allows for easy integration of additional sensors, actuators, and algorithms.

- **Machine Learning:** RoboRover leverages machine learning techniques for tasks such as object recognition, path planning, and decision-making. The robot continuously learns and adapts to its surroundings, enhancing its overall performance.

- **Remote Control:** While capable of autonomous navigation, RoboRover can also be manually controlled through a user-friendly interface. This feature is useful for testing, demonstration, and scenarios where human intervention is required.
